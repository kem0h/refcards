Kem0h Reference Cards (Cheat Sheet)
===================================

This simple git repository is used to host my reference cards.
All of this refcards are under the MIT license (see LICENSE.md file)
Even if thos references card are made for me, I hope that someone
on this planet (or not) will find it useful.
  
It only contains 4 references:
* vim
* markdown
* git
* tmux
  
I use those tools in my day to day work and that's the reason I share those
little memos with you, the geek behind his computer.

> Sincerly Yours !
